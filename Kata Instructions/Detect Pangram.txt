Story:
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at
least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, 
False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
